            <h3>We help with mission temple trips</h3>
            <p>
                Missionaries who want to visit the temple now can do so easily with our missionary programs.
                Local missionaries can ride free on our shuttles to the temple on Preparation Day. Simply have your name
                tag visible to the driver and be on your way to the temple.
                Missionaries also get a discount on our Economy (2 Twin Bed) rooms if they are visiting from further
                away.
                <p><em>*All missionaries who reserve rooms with us must provide written authorization from their mission
                        president*</em></p>
                <p>We are more than happy to work with mission presidents who want to plan a trip for a larger group of
                    missionaries. Please call at least 30 days ahead of time to guarantee enought space.</p>

            <h3>We can accomodate full-time temple missionaries</h3>
            <img class="right" src="images/missionary.jpg" alt="One of the kitchenette rooms for full-time temple missionaries. ">
            <p>
                Have you been assigned to serve as a full-time temple missionary? Do you have full-time temple
                missionaries serving in your mission? Are you stressed about finding mission-approved housing near the
                temple? Look no further, we have what you need!
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of our rooms are not fit for guests to stay long-term. However, we have recently added on to each
                of our Inns a number of kitchenette suites for full-time temple missionaries. These suites will only be
                rented out to Mission Office Personel, guaranteeing that they will be available for the missionaries who
                need it.
