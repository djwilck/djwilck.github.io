                As a marketing website, Brilliant Earth is very good at using visual hierarchy to draw in the consumers
                and direct their attention. When I searched the internet for engagement rings and clicked on their
                website the very first thing I saw was a large beautiful diamond on a finger, followed immediately by
                the button right below it that said "Shop Rings". My first two thoughts from the site were naturally,
                there are the rings, and this is how I can buy them. I then noticed the Title which confirmed that the
                gem was a diamond and not another jewel, and then the last thing my eyes were drawn to was the
                description. The position and size of the ring in the image made sure it was the first thing noticed on
                the website. The next largest thing in the image was the button. By placing it right below the jewel, it
                was likely to be the second or third thing noticed.

                The most common places for buttons to be placed on a phone is in the lower half of the screen. As eBay
                is currently advertising their fall seasonal products, they have placed an array of decent-sized buttons
                right on their main page at thumb height. This is in accordance with Fitt's law, because they have made
                their buttons close enough the thumb of the user and made them large enough that they are easy to click
                without being obnoxious. They have made it much easier for the user to click on those advertised
                products than to scroll through the categories at the top of the screen. Therefore, they have increased
                the chance of a casual browser to view their featured products.

            <p>
                As a well-known professional business, it is no surprise that Forbes has a very clean website design.
                The content is horizontally aligned throughout the website. You can see clearly that the left edge is
                clear with the images, headings, and number of readers. Even the arrows of increase and decrease line up
                clearly and the accompanying headlines are aligned. It clearly defines what content is related and
                separates what is unrelated.
